# Quiz Plugin for WordPress

You can create simple quizzes and questions, and show them on frontend by using shortcodes.

The project was in my archive since 2017 but ive just pushed here to help beginners with code samples. I installed on my local server to test, it seems ok but im still not sure if its working perfect, most probably needs more implementation. If i have enough time in the future, i will try to fix bugs and rebuild the project with React.
